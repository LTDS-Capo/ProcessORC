# ProcessORC

This is a version two processor that is useful for general purpose use.

Primarily the focus of this build is education and teaching people 
how a basic scoreboarding microprocessor works. From there, it is made to
be the primary processor used for the LearnToDoShit Debugging Suite that
is still under development. The CPU is designed to be heavily modifiable
and will have built in IO support for GPIO, PWN, SPI, and I2C.
